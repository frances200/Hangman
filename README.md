# HangPy
## _Hangman written in Python_

This is an OOP solution to Hangman in Python.

## Requirements

- Single player game against computer
- Computer will choose a word and the player will try to guess
- Until the player wants to quit, they should be able to continue with a new round
- The player can make at most 7 wrong guesses, after that s/he loses the game
- Guessing the word letter by letter

The words are chosen from a modified wordlist. The original (unmodified) wordlist is found [here](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000)
The wordlist used only has words with 5 or more characters.

The hangman 'art' used is from [this](https://gist.github.com/chrishorton/8510732aa9a80a03c829b09f12e20d9c) GitHub file.
